British Rainfall volumes between 1867 and the 1961-65 supplement contained an Obituary section.

* **BR_Obituaries.pdf** contains the combined obituary pages from these volumes, as images extracted from scanned versions of the volumes. The scanned
volumes are available as individual PDF files on the [Met Office Archive site](https://digital.nmla.metoffice.gov.uk/?s=%22British+Rainfall%22). 

* **BR_Obituaries_text.pdf** contains text extracted from these obituary page images using the Tesseract-OCR tool. The main purpose
of the text file is to provide a searchable version of the combined obituaries; BR_Obituaries.pdf or the original British Rainfall volumes can then be used 
to read the relevant material more easily.
