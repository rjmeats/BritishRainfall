Blue and black rectangles on the images show the bounding boxes for each 'Word' identified by Amazon Textract. Click within a rectangle to see a pop-up showing the text which Amazon Textract detected. 

Yellow and red rectangles show the bounding boxes for table cells. Click within a rectangle to see a pop-up identifying the row/oolumn of the cell, and the text of the 'Word' associated with the cell. Cells with a 
red border have more than one 'Word' associated with them.

(You can close the pop-ups with the 'Esc' key as well as by pressing the OK button.)

An example where  Textract table detection hasn't worked properly for determining the rows in the table:

* [DR_Anglesey_1871-1880C_p004](DR_Anglesey_1871-1880C_p004.rot.textract-analysis.image_map.html) - the rows determined by Textract gradually get out of alignment with the actual rows of figures in the image
