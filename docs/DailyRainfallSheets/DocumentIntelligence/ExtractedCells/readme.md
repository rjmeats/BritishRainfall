Blue and black rectangles on the images show the bounding boxes for each 'Word' identified by Amazon Textract. Click within a rectangle to see a pop-up showing the text which Amazon Textract detected. 

Yellow and red rectangles show the bounding boxes for table cells. Click within a rectangle to see a pop-up identifying the row/column of the cell, and the text of the 'Word' associated with the cell. Cells with a 
red border have more than one 'Word' associated with them.

(You can close the pop-ups with the 'Esc' key as well as by pressing the OK button.)
