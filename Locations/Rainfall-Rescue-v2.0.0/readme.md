This folder contains files recording the state of [Rainfall Rescue](https://github.com/ed-hawkins/rainfall-rescue) work at the point 
when its [v2.0.0 release](https://github.com/ed-hawkins/rainfall-rescue/releases/tag/v2.0.0) was created (20th January 2022).

The v2.0.0 release was produced using the data-release-v2 branch of the rainfall-rescue repository. This branch combined the latest rainfall content taken from snapshots of the master/main branch of three source repositories, as
recorded in the table below. The git commit IDs in the table record the state of each branch at the point of the V2.0.0 release being generated. Rainfall data in the 'Eire' repository is not included in the V2.0.0 release.
