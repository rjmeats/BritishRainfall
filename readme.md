# British Rainfall

This repository contains some material produced while working on the [Rainfall Rescue Zooniverse project](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/edh/rainfall-rescue) run by [Professor Ed Hawkins](http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~ed/home/index.php). 

The project aims to digitise thousands of pre-1960 hand-written rainfall sheets which recorded monthly rainfall figures at thousands of rain gauges across Britain and Ireland. The sheets are available as images within PDF files on the [Met Office Archive web site](https://digital.nmla.metoffice.gov.uk/).

The Rainfall Rescue GitHub site is at [https://github.com/ed-hawkins/rainfall-rescue](https://github.com/ed-hawkins/rainfall-rescue) - it contains the detailed digitised rainfall data produced by the project.
