# Rain Gauge Maps in *British Rainfall*

The annual *British Rainfall* almanacs sometimes contained useful maps showing the location of rain gauges in selected parts of the country. Here are images of some of the maps I spotted in the earlier editions.

* [The North of Scotland](#the-north-of-scotland)
