# Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&LR) Company Rain Gauges

[MS&LR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester,_Sheffield_and_Lincolnshire_Railway) operated rain gauges across their network for about 70 years between around 1850 and 1922, covering about 50 locations (stations, locks, reservoirs, moorland,...). They became the [Great Central Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Central_Railway) in 1897, and joined with several other railways to form the [LNER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_and_North_Eastern_Railway) at the start of 1923, at which point the rain gauge records stop.

The rainfall sheets for these gauges can be accessed on the [Met Office Archive web site](https://digital.nmla.metoffice.gov.uk/). 

Contents of this folder:

* **MSLR_GaugeInfo.xlsx** is an Excel spreadsheet listing each gauge and a few summary details, for example its period of operation and a grid reference.
* **MSLR_GaugeSheetIndex.csv** identifies the Met Office PDF document and page number for each MS&LR rainfall sheet. It has one row per sheet for each gauge (with each sheet covering a decade of monthly rainfall figures).
* [**1840s.md**](1840s.md) which describes how a few of the MS&LR rain gauges had roots in gauges being used in the 1840s.
* [**Portfolio.md**](Portfolio.md) which lists some railways and canals owned by MS&LR
* [**RainGaugeLocations.md**](RainGaugeLocations.md) describes an attempt to assign grid references to the MS&LR rain gauge locations.
* the **RainfallSheets** folder contains a PDF file for each MS&LR rain gauge location showing the combined set of rainfall sheets for that location, extracted from the Met Office archive.

The transcribed rainfall sheets for the MS&LR gauges (and many others) are available on the Rainfall Rescue GitHub site is at [https://github.com/ed-hawkins/rainfall-rescue](https://github.com/ed-hawkins/rainfall-rescue).

Samuel Homersham, the MS&LR Civil Engineer, produced this [1848 report](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2RUHAAAAQAAJ) (downloadable as a PDF from Google books). It uses data from the early rain gauges to make its case for Manchester getting its clean water supplies from the rain falling on MS&LR moorland. See [**1840s.md**](1840s.md) for more on this.
