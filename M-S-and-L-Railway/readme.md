# Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&LR) Company Rain Gauges

[MS&LR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester,_Sheffield_and_Lincolnshire_Railway) operated rain gauges across their network for about 70 years between around 1850 and 1922, covering about 50 locations (stations, locks, reservoirs, moorland,...). They became the [Great Central Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Central_Railway) in 1897, and joined with several other railways to form the [LNER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_and_North_Eastern_Railway) at the start of 1923, at which point the rain gauge records stop.

The rainfall sheets for these gauges can be accessed on the [Met Office Archive web site](https://digital.nmla.metoffice.gov.uk/). 

Contents of this folder:

* **MSLR_GaugeInfo.xlsx** is an Excel spreadsheet listing each gauge and a few summary details, for example its period of operation.
* **MSLR_GaugeSheetIndex_1860-1922.csv** identifies the Met Office PDF document and page number for each MS&LR rainfall sheet between 1860 and the end of 1922. It has one row per sheet for each gauge (with each sheet covering a decade of monthly rainfall figures).
* **MSLR_GaugeSheetIndex_1850s.csv** as above, but covering the MS&LR rainfall sheets for the 1850s decade.
* **1840s.md** which describes how a few of the MS&LR rain gauges had roots in gauges being used in the 1840s.
* **Portfolio.md** which lists some railways and canals owned by MS&LR

The transcribed rainfall sheets for the MS&LR gauges (and many others) are becoming available on the Rainfall Rescue GitHub site is at [https://github.com/ed-hawkins/rainfall-rescue](https://github.com/ed-hawkins/rainfall-rescue).

The Met Office archive also holds rainfall sheets covering MS&LR gauges for the 1850s, and also some related sheets for the 1840s. 

The MS&LR Civil Engineer produced this [1848 report](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2RUHAAAAQAAJ) (downloadable as a PDF from Google books). It uses data from the early rain gauges to make its case for Manchester getting its clean water supplies from the rain falling on MS&LR moorland. See **1840s.md** for more on this.
