# MS&LR Portfolio

A summary of the transport-related that MS&LR (and later The Great Central Railway) owned over time (not meant to be complete, just what I've come across while trying to locate MS&LR rain gauges.)

## Founder Companies

MS&LR was created by the amalgamation of three existing railway companies:

* the [Sheffield, Ashton under Lyne and Manchester Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield,_Ashton-under-Lyne_and_Manchester_Railway) SA&MR
* the [Great Grimsby and Sheffield Junction Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Grimsby_and_Sheffield_Junction_Railway)
* the [Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_and_Lincolnshire_Junction_Railway)

It came into being at the start of 1847.

The [South Yorkshire Railway and River Dun Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yorkshire_Railway) owned several canals. The company was leased to MS&LR in 1864, and transferred permanently to it in 1874. However in 1895 these canals separated out again into the [Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_and_South_Yorkshire_Navigation), independent of MS&LR. Canals which were part of the MS&LR netword between 184 and 1895 included:

## Private Homes

[John Chapman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Chapman_(Grimsby_MP)), a chairman and directory of MS&LR owned homes at each end of the Woodhead Tunnel:
* Mottram Hill End House
* Carlecotes Hall

Both of these are the location of an MS&LR rain gauge. 

[Colonel George Morland Hutton](https://archive.org/details/visitationengla00britgoog/page/n111/mode/2up) lived at Gate Burton just south of Gainsborough, and was a director of the Great Central Railway. Gate Burton is the location of one of the MS&LR rain gauges.


Another rain gauge location that seem likely to be private homes, but where the family-to-MS&LR link has not been established:

* Edge End in Sheffield ?

[Edward Montagu-Stuart-Wortley-Mackenzie, 1st Earl of Wharncliffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Montagu-Stuart-Wortley-Mackenzie,_1st_Earl_of_Wharncliffe) was Chairman of MS&LR when it became the Great Central Railway in 1897. He owned [Wortley Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wortley_Hall), near Wortley Station on the Woodhead line. The 'Wortley' MS&LR rain gauge could be at either the station or at Wortley Hall.


## Useful Web Sites

.. other than [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/) ...

The [Rail Map Online](http://www.railmaponline.com/UKIEMap.php) site provides an amazingly detailed map of historic railway networks. This has been very useful in working out which parts of the network belonged to MS&LR (labelled as 'Great Central Rly') and which belonged to other companies. It also has a section on canals.

The [Canal and River Trust](https://canalrivertrust.org.uk/enjoy-the-waterways/canal-and-river-network) has detailed maps of the route taken by canals, including locks. However, it only shows stretches of canals still in existence, so for example the western part of the Chesterfield Canal (Norwood Tunnel to Chesterfield) does not appear.

Old OS and other maps provided by the [National Library of Scotland web site](https://maps.nls.uk/). Occasionally these show the exact position of rain gauges, but otherwise show where old railways, canals, stations etc were located, with benchmark heights.
