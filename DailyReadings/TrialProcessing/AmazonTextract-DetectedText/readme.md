# Text detected by Amazon Textract in daily rainfall records

These [images](../RotatedImages) of sample daily rainfall records were processed using Amazon Textract's 'Detect Document Text' API. 

The 'word blocks' detected by Textract in each image are recorded here, using two files for each image:

* a CSV file which lists details of each detected word block, including: 
  * the unique block ID generated by Textract
  * whether Textract thinks the text is 'Printed' or 'Handwriting'
  * the confidence value (0-100) assigned to the detection by Textract
  * the coordinates of the top-left corner of the 'bounding rectangle' which contains the detected text. Coordinates go from (0.000,0.000) in the top-left corner of the image to (1.000,1.000) in the bottom-right corner
  * the detected text (enclosed in square brackets to prevent Excel doing any unwantd auto-formatting)
  
* a JPG image file which draws the word block bounding rectangles on top of the original image:
  * blue rectangles are text detected as 'Handwriting', with black for 'Printed'
  * a thicker border is used where the confidence value is 90+
